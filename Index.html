    <p id="heWas">James Patrick Bulger (16 March 1990 - 12 February 1993) was a boy from Kirkby, Merseyside, England, who was murdered on 12 February 1993, at the age of two. He was abducted, tortured and murdered by two ten-year-old boys, Robert Thompson (born 23 August 1982) and Jon Venables (born 13 August 1982).</p>

    <h1 id="whatHappend" class="mainTitle">What happend?</h1>
    <p id="aboutWhatHappend">James Bulger was the age of only two when he was abducted and brutally murderd by two ten year old boys named Robert Thompson and Jon Venables. James Bulger, who was just short of his third birthday, was murdered in February 1993 by two 10-year-old boys who lured him away from a Liverpool shopping arcade while his mother was distracted. The boys, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, led the crying toddler on a two and a half mile walk across the city to Walton. There, on a rarely used piece of railway, they used bricks and sticks to beat and torture him and finally killed him by repeatedly dropping a 22lbs piece of steel railway track on his head. The killers then placed his body across a rail hoping people would think he had been killed by a train.
    When he was found two days later his body had been cut in half by a freight train but police examinations showed he was already dead before he was run over.
    CCTV from the shopping centre showed him being led away by the two older boys, who were soon caught.
